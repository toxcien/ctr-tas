Cut The Rope mobile TAS for Cardboard Box Level 1-5 made using [Pulover's Macro Creator](https://github.com/Pulover/PuloversMacroCreator)

If you want to test this out you can download ahk file or pmc file which ever software you use. 

After getting the file download [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) if you don't have it yet.
Make sure you have usb debugging enabled on your phone and after that plug your phone to pc.
After extracting scrcpy run the bat file and copy paste "scrcpy -m800 -b2M" to cmd and run it to reduce latency.
